                <p>
                    I am passionating about programming, and loves nothing more
                    than learning new tools, frameworks and dabbling with other
                    languages. My main skills lie with JavaScript and React. I
                    love making SPAs, although I do enjoy a good website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of coding, I enjoy writing, nature, animals and
                    films.

                <p>
                    If you are looking for a bespoke, stand-alone site, or a
                    managable Wordpress site, or custom theme, I'd be happy to
                    help. Or, if you are looking for someone to edit and improve
                    a pre-existing site or page, that's also something I'd be
                    happy to help with. If it's something else, I'm always up
                    for a challenge - let me know and I'll see if I am able to
                    help.

                <p>
                    I am comfortable with a variety of languages, frameworks and
                    tools including HTML, CSS/SASS, JavaScript, React,
                    Node/Express and Wordpress. I use Adobe XD for prototyping,
                    VS Code for most projects, XAMPP for PHP/Wordpress-based
                </p>
                <p>
                    VS Code is my code editor of choice. When developing
                    developing Wordpress projects I use XAMPP.
