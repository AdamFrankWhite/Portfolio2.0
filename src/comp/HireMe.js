                    <p>
                        I strive to create visually pleasing, well-designed
                        sites. I pay close attention to detail - fully
                        responsive layouts, avoiding image display issues and
                        visual bugs is something I take pride in.

                    <p>
                        If you are looking for a bespoke, stand-alone site, or a
                        managable Wordpress site, or custom theme, I'd be happy
                        to help. Or, if you are looking for someone to edit and
                        improve a pre-existing site or page, that's also
                        something I'd be happy to help with. If it's something
                        else, I'm always up for a challenge - let me know and
                        I'll see if I am able to help.

                <p>
                    I am comfortable with a variety of languages, frameworks and
                    tools including HTML, CSS/SASS, JavaScript, React,
                    Node/Express and Wordpress. I use Adobe XD for prototyping,
                    VS Code for most projects, and XAMPP for PHP/Wordpress-based
                    projects.

                    I charge by the project, depending on the complexity and
                    individual requirements. As a general guide, my prices are
                    as follows: a simple brochure-style Wordpress site from
                    Â£495, a bespoke custom site from Â£1295.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For smaller jobs and consultancy, I charge an hourly rate of

                </p>
                <p>
                    Please note, I require 50% deposit before beginning the
                    project, and 50% on completion, before the site is made live
                    and handed over
                </p>
