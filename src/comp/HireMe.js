If you would like a custom-built theme with some more advanced features, but still have the functionality of a Wordpress site, go for the Premium package.

                    I charge by the project, depending on the complexity and
                    individual requirements. As a general guide, I offer three
                    core packages:
                </p>
                <div className="hire-card-cont">
                    {priceCards.map((card) => (
                        <PriceCard card={card} />
                    ))}
                </div>

                <p>
                    For smaller jobs and consultancy, I charge an hourly rate of
                    Â£30/hour.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please note, I require 50% deposit before beginning the
                    project, and 50% on completion, before the site is made live
                    and handed over
                </p>
            </div>
        </section>
    );
