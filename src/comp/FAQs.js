            question: "Which package should I get?",
            answer:
                "If you want to keep costs low, and don't mind using a Wordpress theme template, go for the Standard package. If you would like a custom-built theme with some more advanced features, but still have the functionality of a Wordpress site, go for the Premium package. If you are particularly concerned about speed and performance, and are also keen on a unique, custom design, a site coded from scratch with the Bespoke package would be your best option.",

            question: "Will my website look good on mobile?",
            answer:
                "Mobile responsiveness is vital for a website - it is estimated that around 51% of web traffic is mobile. As such, it is essential that a website looks good and loads fast on a mobile, as well as looking good on both Android and Apple products. This comes as standard in all packages.",

        },
        {
            question: "What is web hosting?",
            answer:
                "Web hosting is the server where your website files actually live. There are a few hosting companies that I recommend in particular.",
            // If you sign up with my affiliate link, you can get a discount on your hosting.
        },
        {
            question: "Do you provide web hosting?",

        },
        {
            question: "Should I get a Wordpress site?",
            answer:
                "Wordpress powers around 30% of the web - its popularity is partly down to its ease of use. As a CMS (Content Management System), you can easily add images and content to your site. If you are looking to update content yourself, a Wordpress site is a good option. However, if you would like all aspects of your site managed for you, I am happy to add/update content for you, as part of a maintainence plan.",
        },

Professionally written copy and professional photographs help with making a website more effective. I can provide a logo branding service if you need a new logo designed for your business.",

        },
        {
            question: "Do you use templates?",
            answer:
                "Only for the standard package is a customised theme template used. The premium and bespoke packages do not use templates. Whilst I may re-use individual components from time to time, all my work is custom-made, coded just for you.",

            question:
                "What is included in the quote? How do I know how much I'll have to pay?",
            answer:
                "I take pricing transparency seriously - no one wants to have a project cost keep on rising. The proposal I provide gives a detailed breakdown of the project scope, exactly what I will provide, how many rounds of revision and how much it costs - so you know exactly how much you are paying and what is included. Please note, however, anything extra outside the scope agreed in the proposal will be chargeable.",

        },
        {
            question: "What technology do you use?",
            answer:
                "I am comfortable with a variety of languages, frameworks and tools including HTML, CSS/SASS, JavaScript, React, Node/Express and Wordpress. I use Adobe XD for prototyping, VS Code my text editor, and XAMPP for PHP/Wordpress-based projects. In my spare time, I continue to learn and study to further enhance my skills.",
