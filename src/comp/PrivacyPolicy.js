                <h2>What data do we collect?</h2>
                <p>Our Company collects the following data:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Personal identification information (Name, email
                        address, phone number, etc.)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>How do we collect your data?</h2>
                <p>
                    You directly provide Our Company with most of the data we
                    collect. We collect data and process data when you:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Register online or place an order for any of our
                        products or services.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Voluntarily complete a customer survey or provide
                        feedback on any of our message boards or via email.
                    </li>
                    <li>Use or view our website via your browser’s cookies.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>How will we use your data?</h2>
                <p>Our Company collects your data so that we can:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Communicate with you regarding your project enquiry</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The proposal is a flexible document so can be happily
                    tweaked until we are happy. Once you’ve accepted the
                    proposal and sent me the first payment, I can get to work.
                </p>
                <h2>Costs</h2>
                <p>
                    When it comes to the cost of a web design project I need to
                    get a good understanding of what you want me to do and the
                    budget you have set aside for the project. I can then tell
                    you what we can achieve together within that budget. Every
                    project is different but generally the cost of creating a
                    website with a built-in content management system starts
                    from £1,500.
                </p>
                <h2>Extra costs</h2>
                <p>
                    During the course of a project there may be some additional
                    costs such as stock photography, web fonts or the purchasing
                    of domain names and hosting. Where possible I’ll make you
                    aware of any extra costs in the proposal.
                </p>
                <h2>Deposit</h2>
                <p>
                    An initial deposit of 50% of the overall cost is required to
                    book a project and payment of the final 50% of the invoice
                    is required before the website goes live.
                </p>
                <h2>Copyright</h2>
                <p>
                    The copyright for design work I create remains my property
                    until I receive final payment for the project, at which
                    point the website becomes your intellectual property.
