                    Before we go any further I think it’s a good idea to let you
                    know what to expect when you work with me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’m a passionate web designer that treats every project with
                    care and respect. In my spare time, I am continually
                    learning new skills and techniques around the world of web
                    design and development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I give each project my full attention: I strive to deliver
                    top-quality work in a timely and well-communicated manner. I
                    know how important communication is in a working
                    relationship - I provide a weekly updates detailing how the
                    project is going, and am always available via email,
                    responding within 2 hours during weekday working hours.
                </p>
                <h2>My approach to web design</h2>
                <p>
                    Every website I create is unique, custom-built to serve the
                    needs of your business. During our initial consultation,
                    we'll establish your business needs, audience, competitors,
                    and what your goals are for the website. I'll then create a
                    proposal for your project.
                </p>
                <h2>Proposals</h2>
                <p>The proposal is a document that details the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>what is included in the project (project scope)</li>
                    <li>
                        costs, with a breakdown of the services provided and
                        payment dates
                    </li>
                    <li>the schedule for the project</li>
                    <li>
                        what I'll need from you (text content, logo, images)
                    </li>
                    <li>the contract detailing our working relationship</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The proposal is a flexible document so can be happily
                    tweaked until we are happy. Once you’ve accepted the
                    proposal and sent me the first payment, I can get to work.
                </p>
                <h2>Costs</h2>
                <p>
                    When it comes to the cost of a web design project I need to
                    get a good understanding of what you want me to do and the
                    budget you have set aside for the project. I can then tell
                    you what we can achieve together within that budget. Every
                    project is different but generally the cost of creating a
                    website with a built-in content management system starts
                    from £1,500.
                </p>
                <h2>Extra costs</h2>
                <p>
                    During the course of a project there may be some additional
                    costs such as stock photography, web fonts or the purchasing
                    of domain names and hosting. Where possible I’ll make you
                    aware of any extra costs in the proposal.
                </p>
                <h2>Deposit</h2>
                <p>
                    An initial deposit of 50% of the overall cost is required to
                    book a project and payment of the final 50% of the invoice
                    is required before the website goes live.
                </p>
                <h2>Copyright</h2>
                <p>
                    The copyright for design work I create remains my property
                    until I receive final payment for the project, at which
                    point the website becomes your intellectual property.
                </p>
