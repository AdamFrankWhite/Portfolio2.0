If you would like a custom-built theme with some more advanced features, but still have the functionality of a Wordpress site, go for the Premium package. If you are particularly concerned about speed and performance, and are also keen on a unique, custom design, a site coded from scratch with the Bespoke package would be your best option.",

If you are looking to update content yourself, a Wordpress site is a good option.

The proposal I provide gives a detailed breakdown of the project scope, exactly what I will provide, how many rounds of revision and how much it costs - so you know exactly how much you are paying and what is included.
