                <h2>What I Can Do For You</h2>
                <hr />
                <p>
                    If you are looking for a bespoke, stand-alone site, or a
                    managable Wordpress site, or custom theme, I'd be happy to
                    help. Or, if you are looking for someone to edit and improve
                    a pre-existing site or page, that's also something I'd be
                    happy to help with. If it's something else, I'm always up
                    for a challenge - let me know and I'll see if I am able to
                    help.
                </p>
                <h2>My Process</h2>
                <hr />
                <p>
                    I will work with you to understand your business needs and
                    the type of site you require (information, blog, sales,
                    editable content). If you are looking for a bespoke site, I
                    will then create some wireframes to give you a feel for the
                    general design, before making some mockups for you to choose
                    from. Then, I will develop your site. Finally, if you need
                    help with setting up web hosting and a domain, I can help
                    with that too, before deploying your site.

                <h2>What Tech Do You Use?</h2>
                <hr />
                <p>
                    I am comfortable with a variety of languages, frameworks and
                    tools including HTML, CSS/SASS, JavaScript, React,
                    Node/Express and Wordpress. I use Adobe XD for prototyping,
                    VS Code for most projects, and XAMPP for PHP/Wordpress-based
                    projects.

                <h2>Pricing</h2>
                <hr />
                <p>
                    I charge by the project, depending on the complexity and
                    individual requirements. As a general guide, my prices are
                    as follows: a simple website from £495. Bespoke custom site
                    from £1095.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For smaller jobs and consultancy, I charge an hourly rate of
                    £30/hour.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please note, I require 25% deposit before beginning the
                    project, and 75% on completion, before the site is made live
                    and handed over
                </p>
            </div>
        </section>
