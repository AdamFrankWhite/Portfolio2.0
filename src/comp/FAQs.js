            question: "Which package should I get?",
            answer: "The packages are a general guide based on the size of the project and typical features. If you want to keep costs low, and only need a simple, smaller site, go for the Standard package; if you have a medium-sized project (up to 10 pages), Premium is the way to go. If you have a larger projecs, and perhaps have advanced features in mind, the Bespoke package is for you. All packages are customisable and are priced according to specific needs.",
        },
        {
            question: "Will my website look good on mobile?",
            answer: "Mobile responsiveness is vital for a website - it is estimated that around 51% of web traffic is mobile. As such, it is essential that a website looks good and loads fast on a mobile, as well as looking good on both Android and Apple products. This comes as standard in all packages.",
        },
        {
            question: "Do I own the website?",
            answer: "100% yes. Once the project is complete and handed over, it is entirely owned by you.",
        },
        {
            question: "Do you provide web hosting?",
            answer: "I don't provive hosting myself, however I am happy to help set this up for you, so you are fully in control. Typical prices range from Â£3-10/month, depending on the length of billing cycle.",
        },
        {
            question: "Should I get a Wordpress site?",
            answer: "Wordpress powers around 30% of the web - its popularity is partly down to its ease of use. As a CMS (Content Management System), you can easily add images and content to your site. If you are looking to update content yourself, a Wordpress site is a good option. However, if you don't have a need or desire to update the site yourself, or are concerned about the drawbacks/limitations of using a CMS, a coded custom site is your best option. I am happy to add/update content for you, on an ad hoc basis.",
        },
        {
            question: "What do you need to get started?",
            answer: "Once we have arranged the project details, I'll need your logo, text content for the website & photos (I can provide stock photos). Professionally written copy and professional photographs help with making a website more effective. I can provide a logo branding service if you need a new logo designed for your business.",
        },
        // {
        //     question: "Do you outsource?",
        //     answer: "If there is something specific you require outside of my skillset - for example, custom graphics - I complete all work myself, so that I know every part of a project, from top to bottom. I'm based in Stockport, Cheshire.",
        // },
        // {
        //     question: "Do you use templates?",
        //     answer: "No.  Whilst I may re-use individual components from time to time, all my work is custom-made, coded just for you.",
        // },

        {
            question:
                "What is included in the quote? How do I know how much I'll have to pay?",
            answer: "I take pricing transparency seriously - no one wants to have a project cost keep on rising. The proposal I provide gives a detailed breakdown of the project scope, exactly what I will provide, how many rounds of revision and how much it costs - so you know exactly how much you are paying and what is included. Please note, however, anything extra outside the scope agreed in the proposal will be chargeable.",
        },
        {
            question: "How long will it take?",
            answer: "I get to work quickly; you can generally expect your site to be up and running within 4-6 weeks, depending on the size of the project and my outstanding project queue. I will be upfront with the timeline in your proposal.",
        },
        {
            question: "What technology do you use?",
            answer: "I am comfortable with a variety of languages, frameworks and tools including HTML, CSS/SASS, JavaScript, React, Node/Express and Wordpress. I use Adobe XD for prototyping, VS Code my text editor, and XAMPP for PHP/Wordpress-based projects. In my spare time, I continue to learn and study to further enhance my skills.",
        },
        {
            question: "Why should I hire you?",
            answer: "As a freelance web developer, I don't have the overheads of an agency. I am also the exclusive point of contact - all things are handled by me. I have a solid understanding of the core programming languages that websites are built with: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP. This means that I can create custom sites and features, improving performance, aesthetics and security. I also believe in frequent communication - no one wants any nasty surprises or disappearing contractors. I am committed to providing a quality experience from start to finish.",
